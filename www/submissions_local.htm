      <h1>Submissions</h1>

<p>Since we began Moon Pie Press in 2003, we have published 100 books (as of 2018).  We aim to release 4 to 6 new books per year for the foreseeable future.  Right now we have books accepted to publish for another year.  That said, we are always looking for new wonderful poetry to consider publishing.  If you have a manuscript, please DO NOT SUBMIT IT unsolicited via email or snail mail.  Email Alice about possibly sending her some sample poems, at <a href='mailto:moonpiepress@yahoo.com'>moonpiepress@yahoo.com</a>. Thank you. We realize that there are many worthy poetry books out there and not enough presses, contests or other outlets to publish them.</p>

<p>We hope you will support our press by buying some of our books. This is also a good way to get a sense of what kind of poetry we are looking for.</p>

<p>In general, what we are looking for when we are reading manuscripts is:</p>

<ul>
<li>A poetry collection 40-75 pages long</li>
<li>At least 3 or 4 of the poems published somewhere in paper or online journals (be sure to include acknowledgments  with your manuscript)</li>
<li>Your best work, and a collection that hangs together</li>
<li>Please, no religious poetry, children’s poetry, or purely political poetry.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>General advice:</b></p>

<ul>
<li>Put thought into choosing and arranging the poems</li>
<li>Make sure these are FINAL versions of your poems</li>
<li>Come up with a good title</li>
<li>Ask people whose literary taste you trust to go over your manuscript and be honest with you about weaknesses, lack of clarity, etc.</li>
<li>Proofread repeatedly and get others to do this for you, too.  It’s very hard to see errors in your own writing.  Spelling mistakes, etc. are unprofessional and show carelessness, and will keep your work from being taken seriously and/or published.</li>
</ul>
