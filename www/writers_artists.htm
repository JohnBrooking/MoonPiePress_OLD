      <p><b><font size="2">THANK YOU for visiting MOON PIE PRESS
        - Where the men are handsome, the women have curves,
        and ALL the poetry is above average.</font></b></p>

      <p>Moon Pie Press was started in 2003 by Alice Persons and Nancy Henry, who met in law school in 1983.  In 2002 they collaborated with Lillian Kennedy on an anthology of Maine poetry called A SENSE OF PLACE - see our book catalog under the CATALOG tab - we have a few copies left.  Moon Pie Press has published 100 books, including 9 anthologies. Nancy left the press in November 2006. Alice is continuing with the press as Editor and Publisher.</p>

      <p>Note that one of the goals of the press has always been to keep book prices low, while striving to produce attractive books.  We make sure that our poets' work is affordable, and hope to get as many books as we can out into the world.  You can help support the poets and make it possible for us to continue to publish fine work by buying our books and spreading the word about what we do.  Thank you for your love of good poetry and your support.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p><b>Cynthia Brackett-Vincent, publisher and editor
          of The Aurorean: </b>&nbsp;<i>Nancy Henry's work is
          imaginative, impeccably thoughtful, imagistic and
          hauntingly beautiful. Her poetry 'takes you there&quot;
          but does so on a multilayered level - truly the work
          of a multitalented poet. To hear her work read aloud would be for me, indeed, a rare treat.</i></p>

David's second chapbook, <a href='http://www.moonpiepress.com/books.php?BookID=32'>You Can Still Go To Hell...and Other Truths About Being A Helping Professional</a>, published in spring 2007, struck a chord with readers (and Writer's Almanac listeners) all over the world, and hundreds of copies of the book have been sold.

        <p><b>Dawn Potter: </b> David Moreau's greatest strength
          is his sweetness--his wide-eyed affection for humanity,
          especially his family, and his willingness to let

          often sharp, David can be a shrewd observer of everyday
          missteps and distractions, expecially his own. David's
          poems are, at heart, paeans to the enduring innocence
          of love, brave devotions to its tenacity.</p>

He has had poems published in small presses and (the now closed) Bangor Theological Seminary's  "The Open Door." His pursuit of the muse is not only through writing, but also in playing music. He has a volunteer gig as a DJ for Colby College radio and identifies with Bob Dylan's words where "... beauty walks a razor's edge, some day I'll make it mine."</p>

      <p>A retired working guy from Boston who got serious about poetry late in life, <span class='style1'>Jack McCarthy</span> calls himself a "standup poetry guy"; others have called him "legend."  He has been featured at venues all over the U.S., in Canada and Europe.  The Boston Globe:  "In the poetry world, he's a rock star."  Stephen Dobyns calls him "one of the wonders of contemporary poetry."  He has been on two national slam teams and brought out 5 books of poetry and 2 CDs.  Among other prizes, he won the haiku championship at the Individual World Poetry Slam.  He lives with his wife, the fabulous Carol, in Lake Stevens, Washington.  Jack's website is <a href='www.standupoet.net'>www.standupoet.net</a>.</p>

      <p>Jack McCarthy (1939-2013) left us on January 17, 2013.  He died peacefully at home after a long fight with cancer.  If you ever got to hear Jack read, you remembered it forever - he was so warm, engaging, profound and often very funny.  Moon Pie Press is very proud to have published one of Jack's poetry books, <a href='http://moonpiepress.com/catalog.php?BookID=59#details'>ALMOST A REMEMBRANCE</a>; all his books are wonderful. </p>

      <p><span class='style1'>Stephen A. Cowperthwaite</span>: As a teacher, I had the reputation of being a storyteller. I missed that part of teaching when I moved to the lake and woods for a Thoreauvian life. I soon found I was much more like Red Green than HDT. I'm happiest when I'm creative rather then meditative. I built my house, lots of small buildings, round woodpiles, fixed boats and published some history. I love Senior College at UMA and am a regular. In Ted Bookey's poetry class, I learned I could tell stories through poetry. Occasionally one comes to me, and I just write it down. That's rare. Usually it takes time and lots of crafting. It's sort of like building a boat or a perfect privy. It's enormously satisfying and I am greatly indebted to Ted and so many dear friends and fellow writers for their suggestions and encouragement. Memories of my childhood on a hardscrabble farm here in Maine are a great source for me. I live in a beautiful place that I love and love to share with my dear family and friends. Nature is all around. I love history and especially the history of what happened right here, but I've enjoyed traveling in Russia in recent years. I love humor. I've lived in Maine most of my life. I love Maine, Mainiacs and even folks from away.</p>

His prior books of poetry are <i>Strike Back Cover</i> (1986), <i>The Butter Poems</i> (1996) and <i>Left Brain-Right Brain</i> (2007). He has written poems in the French, Italian, Spanish, and Turkish languages.
